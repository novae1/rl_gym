******************** Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<start_working_out>
Let $C$ be the cost of each ticket, so $C = 40$.
Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets.
The number of tickets that are less than or equal to 10 is $12 - 10 = 2$.
The discount is 5% for every ticket bought that exceeds 10.
The number of tickets that are greater than 10 is 2.
The discount amount for each of these tickets is $5\%$ of the price of the ticket.
The price of each ticket exceeding 10 is $40 + 0.05 \times 40 = 40 + 2 = 42$.
The total cost of the 2 tickets with a discount is $2 \times 42 = 84$.
The total cost of the 10 tickets at the regular price is $12 \times 40 = 480$.
The total cost of the 2 tickets with a discount is $2 \times (40 + 0.05 \times 40) = 2 \times (40 + 2) = 2 \times 42 = 84$.
The total cost of the 12 tickets is $12 \times 40 = 480$.
The total discount amount is $84 \times 0.05 = 4.2$.
The total cost Mr. Benson paid is $480 - 4.2 = 475.8$.
However, we are given that Mr. Benson received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10.
The number of tickets bought that are less than or equal to 10 is $12 - 10 = 2$.
The price of each ticket that is less than or equal to 10 is $40$.
The total cost for these 2 tickets is $2 \times 40 = 80$.
The number of tickets that are greater than 10 is $12 - 2 = 10$.
The discount for each of these 10 tickets is 5% of the price of the ticket.
The price of each ticket exceeding 10 is $40 + 0.05 \times 40 = 40 + 2 = 42$.
The total cost for these 10 tickets is $10 \times 42 = 420$.
The total cost of the 12 tickets is $80 + 420 = 500$.
However, the problem states that Mr. Benson received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10.
So, for each ticket exceeding 10, we pay $40 + 0.05(40) = 40 + 2 = 42$.
The number of tickets exceeding 10 is $12 - 10 = 2$.
The total cost for these 2 tickets is $2 \times 42 = 84$.
The total cost of the 12 tickets is $12 \times 40 = 480$.
The total discount is $84 \times 0.05 = 4.2$.
The total cost Mr. Benson paid is $480 - 4.2 = 475.8$.

The problem is a bit ambiguous. Let's rephrase it.
Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets. The cost of each ticket is $40.
The discount is 5% for every ticket bought that exceeds 10.
Number of tickets exceeding 10 = $12 - 10 = 2$.
The discount amount for each of these 2 tickets is $5\%$ of the price of the ticket.
Price of each ticket exceeding 10 is $40 + 0.05 \times 40 = 40 + 2 = 42$.
Total cost of 2 tickets with discount is $2 \times 42 = 84$.
The total cost of the 12 tickets without discount is $12 \times 40 = 480$.
Total discount amount is $84 \times 0.05 = 4.2$.
Total cost Mr. Benson paid is $480 - 4.2 = 475.8$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{475.80}$
